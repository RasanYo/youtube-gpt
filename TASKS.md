# Context Refactoring Implementation Plan

## üß† Context about Project

YouTube-GPT is an intelligent AI-powered YouTube search application that helps users instantly find information hidden inside hours of video content. Users can add individual videos or full channels to create a searchable personal knowledge base, search across multiple videos, ask AI questions, and get grounded answers with citations and timestamps.

The application is built with Next.js 14 (App Router), uses Supabase for backend services (auth, database, storage, realtime), and employs React Context API for state management across three key domains: authentication (AuthContext), conversation management (ConversationContext), and video selection (VideoSelectionContext).

The system is currently in active development, with basic functionality implemented including authentication, video ingestion, conversation management, and AI-powered chat with scope-aware retrieval. This refactoring targets improving code quality, maintainability, and performance of the context layer that orchestrates global state.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The context files (`src/contexts/`) are responsible for managing global application state. They use React Context API to share state across components without prop drilling. The three contexts work together to manage different aspects of the user's session:

- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state, session, and auth methods. Currently handles Supabase authentication with magic link OTP and includes hydration mismatch prevention.

- **ConversationContext**: Manages conversation list, active conversation, and CRUD operations. Contains complex auto-initialization logic to create the first conversation automatically, with intricate dependency chains in useEffect hooks.

- **VideoSelectionContext**: Manages selected videos for scope-aware chat. Simple state management using Set data structure, but has some unnecessary memoization.

The refactoring will simplify overly complex patterns, remove unnecessary optimizations, standardize error handling, and add comprehensive documentation. Components like `chat-area.tsx`, `authenticated-chat-area.tsx`, `knowledge-base.tsx`, and `conversation-sidebar.tsx` depend on these contexts, so changes must maintain backward compatibility.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

The refactored contexts will maintain all existing functionality while being simpler, more maintainable, and better documented. The key improvements are:

1. **Simplified ConversationContext**: Replace complex auto-creation logic with explicit initialization flags to reduce useEffect dependency chains and prevent race conditions.

2. **Optimized VideoSelectionContext**: Remove unnecessary `useCallback` wrapper around simple getter functions, relying on reference equality from the memoized context value.

3. **Standardized Error Handling**: All contexts will have consistent error handling patterns with user-facing error states and proper error propagation.

4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public functions and key implementation details for better developer experience.

5. **Verification**: Add runtime checks to ensure refactored contexts maintain correct behavior - auto-creation still works, video selection persists, authentication state is stable.

The refactoring should be transparent to end users - no UI changes, no breaking API changes. Components consuming these contexts should work without modification.

## üìã Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks
