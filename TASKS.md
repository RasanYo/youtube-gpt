# ZeroEntropy Transcript Processing Pipeline Implementation Plan

## üß† Context about Project

**YouTube-GPT** is an AI-powered YouTube knowledge base that transforms hours of video content into an instantly searchable, intelligent assistant. The platform enables users to find specific information quickly in video content, generate shareable content (LinkedIn posts, summaries), and get grounded answers with citations and timestamps. 

The system currently uses a three-column ChatGPT-style interface with conversation history, real-time chat, and a knowledge base explorer. Built on Next.js 14 with Supabase for authentication and database, the platform processes YouTube videos through an Inngest-based pipeline that extracts transcripts and prepares them for AI-powered search and retrieval.

The project is currently in the implementation phase with the foundation (UI, auth, database) complete and the AI processing pipeline being built. The existing video processing pipeline extracts transcripts from YouTube videos but lacks vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities needed for the core RAG functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The ZeroEntropy transcript processing pipeline is a critical component that bridges the gap between raw video transcripts and intelligent AI responses. Currently, the system extracts transcripts using `youtube-transcript-plus` and stores basic video metadata in Supabase, but lacks the vector search capabilities needed for semantic retrieval.

The feature integrates with the existing Inngest video processing pipeline (`src/lib/inngest/functions/process-video.ts`) which currently handles: PENDING ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí PROCESSING ‚Üí TRANSCRIPT_EXTRACTING ‚Üí READY/FAILED status flow. The pipeline needs to be extended to include ZeroEntropy processing for vector embeddings and page-based indexing.

Key technical constraints include: multi-tenant data isolation via Supabase RLS, real-time status updates via Supabase Realtime, and the need to preserve precise timestamp mapping for accurate video citations. The system must handle sentence fragmentation in transcripts and ensure proper user scoping for collections.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

The end-to-end flow enables users to ask questions about their video content and receive AI responses with precise video references and timestamps (e.g., "Video: Sarkozy and the Libya case, Timestamp: 01:38 - 02:40"). 

When a user adds a YouTube video, the system processes it through: URL validation ‚Üí metadata extraction ‚Üí transcript extraction ‚Üí ZeroEntropy indexing with timestamp mapping ‚Üí vector embedding generation ‚Üí storage in user-scoped collections. Each transcript segment becomes a "page" in ZeroEntropy with metadata including video ID, title, duration, and precise timestamps.

During chat interactions, user queries trigger semantic search across the user's video collection, retrieving relevant transcript segments with timestamps. The AI generates responses grounded in the retrieved content, providing specific video references and timestamps for verification. The system maintains conversation context and allows users to select specific videos for focused interactions.
