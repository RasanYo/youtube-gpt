# Add Markdown Rendering Support for AI Responses

## üß† Context about Project

YouTube-GPT is a full-stack AI-powered YouTube search application that transforms hours of video content into an instantly searchable, AI-powered knowledge base. The platform helps content creators, researchers, students, and professionals efficiently extract, search, and repurpose information from their personal video libraries.

Users can add individual videos or entire channels, search across their knowledge base, ask AI questions with RAG-powered retrieval, and generate content (LinkedIn posts, summaries, etc.) from their video collection. The application is built using Next.js 14 with App Router, Supabase for backend and authentication, Inngest for background jobs, and the AI SDK for streaming chat interactions.

Currently, the platform is in active development with a three-column ChatGPT-style interface (conversation sidebar, chat area, and knowledge base explorer). The focus is on polishing the UI/UX and enhancing AI response formatting to improve readability and comprehension.

**Project Stage**: Active development with core features implemented. Currently working on issue #50: Redesign UI with new color theme and improved styling.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The chat interface currently renders AI responses as plain text using basic React rendering (line 40 in `chat-message.tsx`). This means any markdown formatting in AI responses (`**bold text**`, `# headers`, lists, code blocks, etc.) appears as raw markdown syntax rather than formatted content.

**Current Implementation**:
- `ChatMessage` component in `src/components/chat/chat-message.tsx` handles rendering of all message parts
- Text parts (line 39-40) are wrapped in a simple `<div>` with no markdown processing
- The component supports video references from RAG searches and tool usage notifications
- Messages are part of the AI SDK's `UIMessage` type structure

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must work with the AI SDK's streaming architecture
- Should preserve existing functionality (video references, tool notifications, loading states)
- Needs to respect the existing design system (light/dark mode, color tokens)
- Must be performant for real-time streaming updates

**Architecture Context**:
- The application uses the AI SDK's `UIMessage` type where messages have `parts` array
- Each part has a `type` field ('text', 'tool-searchKnowledgeBase', etc.)
- Text parts contain the AI's generated content
- The component already handles different message roles (user vs assistant) and styling

**Dependencies**:
- `@tailwindcss/typography` is already in devDependencies but not configured in `tailwind.config.ts`
- No markdown libraries are currently installed
- Using shadcn/ui components for consistency

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

The goal is to enhance AI response rendering by adding support for markdown formatting. When the AI generates responses with markdown syntax (bold text, headers, lists, code blocks), these should be rendered as properly formatted, styled content rather than raw markdown.

**User Experience**:
- AI responses with `**bold text**` should appear as bold text
- Headers (`# Heading`) should be rendered with appropriate sizing and weight
- Lists (both numbered and unordered) should be properly formatted with indentation
- Code blocks and inline code should be visually distinct with appropriate styling
- The formatting should feel native to the chat interface without disrupting the conversation flow
- It should work seamlessly in both light and dark modes

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Maintain the existing message bubble styling (rounded, with appropriate colors for user/assistant messages)
- Markdown formatting should enhance readability without overwhelming the interface
- The formatting should follow existing spacing and typography patterns

**Data Flow**:
1. AI generates response with markdown syntax
2. Stream is received by `AuthenticatedChatArea` component
3. Message is added to messages array with text parts
4. `ChatMessage` component receives message with text parts
5. Text parts are now rendered through `ReactMarkdown` which parses markdown
6. Parsed elements are styled using Tailwind classes
7. User sees formatted content in chat interface

## üìã Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

- [x] Add prose color overrides to match the application's theme
- [x] This ensures markdown content looks good in both light and dark modes

---

### Task 3: Create Markdown Renderer Component

**Goal**: Build a custom component with styled markdown elements

#### Subtask 3.1: Define custom markdown components
- [x] In `chat-message.tsx`, add a `markdownComponents` constant before the component
- [x] Define custom renderers for each markdown element:
  - `p`: Add margin bottom of `mb-3 last:mb-0` for paragraph spacing
  - `strong`: Add `font-bold` class for bold text
  - `em`: Add `italic` class for emphasized text
  - `h1`: Add `text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-4` for main headings
  - `h2`: Add `text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-3` for secondary headings
  - `h3`: Add `text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-3` for tertiary headings
  - `ul`: Add `list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1` for unordered lists
  - `ol`: Add `list-decimal list-inside mb-3 space-y-1` for ordered lists
  - `li`: Add `ml-2` for list item indentation
  - `code`: Conditional styling - inline: `bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-sm`, block: `block bg-muted p-2 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto`
  - `blockquote`: Add `border-l-4 border-muted-foreground/20 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground` for quote styling

#### Subtask 3.2: Import ReactMarkdown and remarkGfm
- [x] Add imports at the top of `chat-message.tsx`:
  - `import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'`
  - `import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'`
- [x] Ensure these imports are placed before the component definition

2. **`tailwind.config.ts`** - Add typography plugin
3. **`src/components/chat/chat-message.tsx`** - Integrate markdown rendering (OPTIONAL - reverted to plain text)
4. **`src/styles/globals.css`** - Optional prose configuration

## Expected Outcome

After implementation, AI responses will properly render markdown formatting including:
- **Bold text** from `**bold**` syntax
- Headers from `#`, `##`, `###` syntax
- Numbered and bulleted lists
- Inline code from `` `code` `` syntax
- Block code from triple backticks
- Blockquotes from `>` syntax
- All formatting will be styled to match the application's design system and work in both light and dark modes

**Additional Enhancement**: The AI system prompt has been updated to encourage the use of markdown formatting in responses, ensuring that the AI naturally produces well-formatted, structured content that takes full advantage of the new markdown rendering capabilities.
