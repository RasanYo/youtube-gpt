# Redesign UI with New Color Theme and Improved Styling - Implementation Plan

## 🧠 Context about Project

YouTube-GPT is a full-stack AI-powered YouTube search application that helps users find specific information from hours of video content. Users can add individual videos or full YouTube channels to build a searchable personal knowledge base, search across multiple videos, ask AI questions, and get grounded answers with citations and timestamps. The application uses Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase for database and auth, Prisma ORM, Inngest for background jobs, ZeroEntropy for vector embeddings, and Claude for LLM interactions. The current implementation has a basic UI with standard shadcn/ui components, but lacks a cohesive design system with proper spacing, color theming, and polished interactive elements. The conversation sidebar is currently functional but has minimal visual feedback and limited interactivity.

## 🏗️ Context about Feature

This feature focuses on redesigning the ConversationSidebar to improve visual hierarchy, user feedback, and interaction patterns. The conversation sidebar is located in `src/components/layout/conversation-sidebar.tsx` and consists of a `ConversationItem` sub-component that displays conversation history. Currently, the active state uses a simple background color with no rounded borders, text sizes are standard, and there's no menu for actions like editing or deleting conversations. The `ConversationContext` (`src/contexts/ConversationContext.tsx`) already provides `updateConversationTitle` functionality (line 227-252), but UI lacks access to it. The sidebar uses shadcn/ui components (`Button`, `Avatar`, `ScrollArea`, etc.) and Tailwind CSS for styling. Color variables are defined in `src/styles/globals.css` using HSL values, with separate light and dark modes. The component needs to maintain accessibility standards (keyboard navigation, contrast ratios) and support both themes.

## 🎯 Feature Vision & Flow

The redesigned conversation sidebar will provide a modern, dense, and interactive experience. Each conversation item will have rounded borders on both sides when active (creating a card-like appearance), reduced text sizes for better information density, and a 3-dot menu button that appears on hover with options to edit the title or delete the conversation. Hover interactions will smoothly transition states, and the menu will use shadcn/ui's DropdownMenu component with proper keyboard navigation. The edit functionality will use an inline edit pattern with a Dialog component, while delete will use an AlertDialog for confirmation. Visual hierarchy will be enhanced through consistent spacing (8px, 12px, 16px), smaller text sizes (text-xs for title, text-[10px] for timestamp), and clearer active/inactive states using border colors and background tints. The overall experience should feel polished, professional, and aligned with modern chat application patterns.

## 📋 Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

### Phase 1: Component Structure & State Management
- [x] **Task 1.1: Add imports and setup hover state**
  - Import `MoreVertical`, `Pencil`, `Trash2` icons from `lucide-react` in `conversation-sidebar.tsx` (line 3)
  - Import DropdownMenu components: `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuSeparator` from `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu`
  - Add `useState` import to React imports if not present (line 20)
  - Add `showMenu` state variable inside `ConversationItem` component using `useState(false)`
  - Update component signature to handle hover state with `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` handlers

- [x] **Task 1.2: Validate imports and components**
  - Run `pnpm run lint` to ensure no import errors
  - Verify all imported components exist in `src/components/ui/`
  - Check that lucide-react icons are properly typed

---

  - Ensure button doesn't trigger parent click with `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`

- [x] **Task 3.2: Implement menu content and items**
  - Add `DropdownMenuContent` with `align="end"` and `min-w-[140px]`
  - Add first menu item: "Edit title" with `Pencil` icon, using `DropdownMenuItem`

  - Extract the menu button and dropdown into a new component `ConversationMenuItem`
  - Create interface `ConversationMenuItemProps` with `conversationId` and callback props
  - Move all menu-related JSX to the new component
  - Import and use the component inside `ConversationItem`
  - Ensure proper prop passing and event handling
  - NOTE: Skipped - file is manageable at ~300 lines

- [x] **Task 4.2: Validate component decomposition**
  - Check that the file doesn't exceed 200 lines (if it does, create separate file)
  - Verify functionality remains identical after refactoring
  - Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
  - Run linter to check for any issues
