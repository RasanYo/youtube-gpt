# Langfuse Observability Integration Plan

## üß† Context about Project

**YouTube-GPT** is an AI-powered SaaS platform that transforms YouTube video content into an instantly searchable, AI-powered knowledge base. The platform helps users extract, search, and repurpose information from hours of video content through intelligent retrieval and AI-assisted question answering.

The system allows users to:
- **Ingest** individual videos or entire channels (latest 10 videos)
- **Search** across their personal video knowledge base using semantic search
- **Ask questions** with AI-powered retrieval and get grounded answers with citations
- **Generate content** (LinkedIn posts, summaries, outlines) from selected videos
- **Multi-select videos** to create focused context for AI interactions

**Current Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Realtime)
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7
- **Vector Search**: ZeroEntropy for embeddings and semantic search
- **Background Jobs**: Inngest for async video processing
- **LLM Features**: Multi-step tool calling (up to 5 steps), RAG with video context

The platform is in active development with core features like authentication, video ingestion, RAG chat, and background processing already implemented. However, **observability is currently limited to console logs**, making production debugging and optimization challenging.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

**Langfuse Observability Integration** adds comprehensive tracing and monitoring across the entire AI pipeline from user queries through LLM responses. This integration captures traces, generations, spans, and tool calls to enable production debugging, performance optimization, cost tracking, and quality monitoring.

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Main LLM Entry Point**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Handles streaming chat with Claude via `streamText` from AI SDK
- **Tool Execution**: `src/lib/tools/search-tool.ts` - Executes ZeroEntropy RAG searches as tools
- **Vector Search**: `src/lib/search-videos.ts` - Performs semantic search across video embeddings
- **Background Processing**: `src/lib/inngest/functions/process-video.ts` - Multi-step video processing pipeline
- **Title Generation**: `src/app/api/generate-title/route.ts` - Uses `generateText` for conversation titles

**Integration Points:**
- AI SDK compatibility via `@langfuse/ai` package with automatic tracing of LLM calls, tool calls, and generations
- Server-side tracing via callbacks passed to `streamText` and `generateText` in Next.js API routes
- Automatic tool call tracing (no manual instrumentation needed) for RAG retrieval in chat endpoint
- Manual tracing for background jobs (Inngest video processing) using direct Langfuse client API

**Constraints:**
- Must preserve existing console logging for local debugging
- Must be non-blocking (async/background tracing)
- Must support both production (cloud) and development (self-hosted) deployments
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Vercel AI SDK patterns

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

Users will experience no UI changes, but developers and operators gain powerful observability tools:

**End-to-End Flow:**
1. **User sends chat message** ‚Üí Creates Langfuse trace with userId, conversationId, scope
2. **LLM processes request** ‚Üí Records generation with model, tokens, latency, cost
3. **Tool calls triggered** ‚Üí Captures search queries, results, relevance scores, video IDs
4. **Streaming response** ‚Üí Tracks token-by-token output, citations extracted
5. **Production monitoring** ‚Üí Dashboard shows traces, errors, performance metrics

**Key Metrics:**
- **Performance**: Request latency, token usage, streaming speed
- **Cost**: API costs per conversation, cumulative spend, cost-per-user
- **Quality**: Tool call accuracy, retrieval relevance, citation rates
- **Debugging**: Full trace context, error logs, step-by-step execution
- **Business**: Active users, queries per video, feature adoption

**Success Criteria:**
- Every LLM call traces to Langfuse with full context
- Tool calls logged with inputs/outputs and timing
- Production errors immediately traceable to specific trace
- Cost and performance metrics visible in dashboard
- Developers can debug production issues without code changes

## üìù Notes

### Implementation Approach
- **AI SDK Integration**: Use `@langfuse/ai` package with `instrumentLangfuse()` callback pattern via `experimental_telemetry` parameter
- **Automatic Tracing**: Tool calls, generations, and spans are automatically created by Langfuse AI SDK integration - no manual instrumentation needed
- **Manual Tracing**: Only background jobs (Inngest) require manual `langfuse.trace()` creation
- **Client Pattern**: Create singleton Langfuse client for direct API usage in background jobs

### Performance & Reliability
- **Tracing Overhead**: Target < 100ms per request
- **Error Resilience**: Tracing failures must never break core functionality
- **Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive user data leaked in traces (sanitize inputs)
- **Cost Monitoring**: Watch Langfuse usage to avoid unexpected costs

### Best Practices
- **Team Training**: Document Langfuse dashboard usage for debugging
- **Gradual Rollout**: Consider feature flag for production rollout
- **Code Quality**: No new file created should exceed 150 lines; break into smaller modules if needed
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid unnecessary code repetition; extract shared utilities and helpers when appropriate
