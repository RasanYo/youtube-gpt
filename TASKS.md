# Implementation Plan: Conversation Rename & Delete Features

## üß† Context about Project

**YouTube-GPT** is an AI-powered full-stack SaaS application that enables users to search, analyze, and extract information from YouTube video content. The platform allows users to add individual videos or entire channels to build a searchable knowledge base. Users can ask AI-powered questions across their video library and receive grounded answers with citations and timestamps.

The application uses Next.js 14 with App Router, Supabase for authentication and database operations, and implements a ChatGPT-style three-column interface. The system is built with full-stack vertical slices, focusing on reliability, scalability, and design quality. At its current stage, the app has basic conversation management, video ingestion, and chat functionality implemented, but lacks complete CRUD operations for conversations.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The conversation management system is currently built on top of the `ConversationContext`, which provides state management for the user's conversation list. The UI includes dropdown menus with "Edit title" and "Delete" options in the conversation item component (`conversation-item.tsx`), but only the edit functionality is fully implemented. The database operations are separated into `src/lib/supabase/conversations.ts`, which currently provides `getConversationsByUserId`, `createConversation`, and `updateConversationTitle` functions.

The messages table has a foreign key relationship to conversations with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, which means deleting a conversation will automatically delete all associated messages. The rename feature is already complete‚Äîit's wired through the context and database layers. However, the delete functionality needs to be implemented at the database, context, and UI layers.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

Users should be able to:
1. **Rename conversations** (already implemented): Click the three-dot menu on any conversation, select "Edit title," modify the title in a dialog, and have the change persist to the database and update the UI immediately.
2. **Delete conversations**: Click the three-dot menu, select "Delete," confirm in an alert dialog, and have the conversation removed from the database (with cascading message deletion) and updated in the UI. If the deleted conversation was the active one, the UI should switch to another conversation or show an empty state.

The system must handle error states gracefully, preserve data integrity through RLS policies, and maintain optimistic UI updates where appropriate.

## üìã Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

### Phase 1: Database Layer - Add Delete Function

- [x] **Task 1.1**: Add `deleteConversation` function to `src/lib/supabase/conversations.ts`
  - [x] Add the function signature: `export async function deleteConversation(conversationId: string): Promise<void>`
  - [x] Implement Supabase `.delete()` call with proper error handling matching the existing pattern
  - [x] Add JSDoc documentation explaining the function's purpose and parameters
  - [x] Ensure the function follows the same try-catch pattern as other functions in the file
  
  **Files to modify**: `src/lib/supabase/conversations.ts`
  
  **Validation**: 
  - Function should delete by `id` column

  - [x] Add proper error handling with try-catch, error state updates, and re-throw
  - [x] Use `useCallback` with appropriate dependencies: `[user, activeConversationId, conversations]`

  - [x] Add `deleteConversation` to the `value` object at line 285-295
  - [x] Add `clearError` to the `value` object (from Task 2.3c)
  
  **Files to modify**: `src/contexts/ConversationContext.tsx` (line 294)
  
  **Validation**: 
  - Both methods should be added to the context value object

  - [ ] Test `clearError` function is accessible (if implemented in UI)
  - [ ] Verify retry mechanism works
  - [ ] Verify error state can be manually cleared
  
  **Validation**:

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Rename Feature** (Already Complete):
- Users can click edit from dropdown and modify conversation titles
- Changes persist to database and update UI immediately
- All existing functionality continues to work

‚úÖ **Delete Feature** (To Be Implemented):
- Users can delete conversations from the dropdown menu
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Deleted conversations are removed from database and UI
- Associated messages are automatically deleted (cascade)
- Active conversation handling works correctly
- Error states are handled gracefully
- No data integrity issues or console errors
- Race condition protection prevents concurrent deletions
- Existence validation prevents unnecessary database calls
- User-triggered error recovery via `clearError` method

## üìù Notes

### Database Security
- The database has `ON DELETE CASCADE` enabled, so messages will be automatically deleted
- RLS policies ensure users can only delete their own conversations at the database level
- `auth.uid() = user_id` policy prevents unauthorized access even if client is compromised

### Implementation Security
- **Race condition protection**: `isDeleting` state prevents concurrent delete operations
- **Existence validation**: Pre-checks conversation exists in local state before database calls
- **Error recovery**: Graceful degradation with user-triggered error clearing
- **UI consistency**: Error handling prevents orphaned states in the UI

### Technical Details
- The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase
- No migrations needed as database schema already supports DELETE operations
- Both features use existing UI components (Dialog, AlertDialog) from shadcn/ui
- Supabase client uses PKCE flow for enhanced security on authentication
- Session persistence and auto-refresh ensure continuous authentication
