## üß† Context about Project

**YouTube-GPT** is a full-stack AI-powered YouTube search application that helps users instantly find information hidden inside hours of video content. Users can add individual videos or full channels to create a searchable personal knowledge base, search across multiple videos, ask AI questions, and get grounded answers with citations and timestamps.

The platform serves content creators, researchers, students, and professionals who consume YouTube content regularly and need to efficiently extract, search, and repurpose information from their video libraries. The application is built using Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase for authentication and backend, Inngest for background jobs, ZeroEntropy for vector embeddings, and the AI SDK for streaming chat interactions.

**Current Stage**: The application has a three-column ChatGPT-style interface (conversation sidebar, chat area, knowledge base explorer). Core features are implemented and working. Currently working on issue #50: Redesign UI with new color theme and improved styling, which includes adding markdown rendering support for AI responses.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The chat interface currently renders AI responses as plain text using basic React rendering (line 40 in `src/components/chat/chat-message.tsx`). This means any markdown formatting in AI responses (`**bold text**`, `# headers`, lists, code blocks, etc.) appears as raw markdown syntax rather than formatted content.

**Current Implementation**:
- `ChatMessage` component in `src/components/chat/chat-message.tsx` handles rendering of all message parts
- Text parts (line 39-40) are wrapped in a simple `<div>` with no markdown processing
- The component supports video references from RAG searches and tool usage notifications
- Messages are part of the AI SDK's `UIMessage` type structure with `parts` array
- Streaming works correctly with the `useChat` hook from `@ai-sdk/react`

**Technical Architecture**:
- Uses AI SDK (`ai` v5.x) for streaming responses
- Messages use `UIMessage` type with `parts` array containing different part types
- Chat API route at `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` streams responses using `streamText` from AI SDK
- Progressive message generation is already working in `src/components/chat/authenticated-chat-area.tsx`
- The design system uses HSL color tokens defined in `src/styles/globals.css`

**Constraint**: We previously removed `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` to explore AI SDK Elements as an alternative solution that integrates better with the AI SDK ecosystem.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

When users receive AI responses containing markdown formatting (bold text, headers, lists, code blocks, links, etc.), these should be rendered as properly formatted HTML elements rather than raw markdown syntax.

**End-to-End Flow**:
1. AI generates response with markdown syntax (e.g., "Here are **three key points**: 1. Point one 2. Point two 3. Point three")
2. Response streams through AI SDK via `useChat` hook
3. Messages update progressively in the UI as chunks arrive
4. `ChatMessage` component receives text parts
5. AI SDK Elements `Response` component renders markdown with proper styling
6. User sees formatted content: bold text, proper lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, etc.
7. Video references and tool notifications continue to work alongside markdown content

**UX Expectations**:
- Markdown renders progressively as it streams (no flicker or reflow issues)
- Maintains existing styling and layout (YouTube-inspired clean design)
- Works seamlessly with existing video reference cards
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features like tables, task lists, strikethrough
- Code blocks have syntax highlighting
- Works in both light and dark modes

## üìã Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

### Task 1: Install AI SDK Elements Response Component

**Goal**: Add the Response component from AI SDK Elements to the project

#### Subtask 1.1: Install Response component using AI Elements CLI
- [x] Run command: `npx ai-elements@latest add response`
- [x] This will install the Response component and its dependencies
- [x] Verify that new files are created in `src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx`

#### Subtask 1.2: Verify installation
- [x] Check that `package.json` has new dependencies added by the installation
- [x] Confirm that the `src/components/ai-elements/` directory exists
- [x] Verify the Response component files are in `src/components/ai-elements/`

#### Subtask 1.3: Install Streamdown CSS styles
- [x] Open `src/styles/globals.css` file
- [x] Add the import for Streamdown styles at the top: `@import "streamdown/dist/index.css";`
- [x] This provides the necessary CSS for markdown rendering and syntax highlighting

---

### ‚úÖ Validation Criteria for Task 1

**What to verify before proceeding to Task 2:**
- [x] `npx ai-elements@latest add response` command completed without errors
- [x] `src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx` file exists with component
- [x] `package.json` shows new dependencies (streamdown package added)
- [x] `src/styles/globals.css` contains the Streamdown CSS import
- [x] No linter errors in modified files
- [x] Ready to integrate Response component into ChatMessage

**Expected Results:**
- Response component is installed and accessible via `@/components/ai-elements/response`
- Streamdown CSS is imported and available for markdown styling
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**How to Test:**
- Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check that `src/components/ai-elements/response/` directory contains index files
- Verify CSS import is at the top of globals.css after other imports
- Attempt to build: `pnpm run build` (should complete without errors)

**Exit Criteria:** All installation steps complete without errors. Ready to integrate Response component.
