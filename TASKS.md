# Inngest Functions Refactoring Plan

## üß† Context about Project

YouTube-GPT is an AI-powered YouTube knowledge management platform that uses Inngest for background job processing. The system handles video transcript extraction, ZeroEntropy indexing, and cleanup operations. The current Inngest functions follow Inngest conventions but suffer from excessive logging (50+ console.log statements across files), code duplication (repeated logging patterns, redundant error handling), and file size issues (process-video.ts at 360 lines mixes multiple concerns). The functions are functional but need refactoring for better maintainability and readability.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The Inngest directory contains the client setup, event triggers, and background job functions. The current issues include: verbose logging scattered throughout functions, redundant console.log statements that duplicate information, unused type assertions, a 360-line process-video.ts file that mixes helper functions with main logic, and inconsistent step naming (like "log-completion" in delete-user-collection.ts that doesn't perform actual work). The refactoring will create a logging utility, extract helper functions, reduce duplication, and improve file organization while maintaining all existing functionality.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

The refactored Inngest functions will be cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to debug. Logging will be consolidated into a structured utility. Helper functions will be extracted into separate files for better testability. Code duplication will be eliminated. Files will be more focused and readable. The background job processing will work exactly as before, but developers will have cleaner code to work with. The implementation will preserve all functionality, error handling, retries, and step orchestration.

## üìã Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

### Phase 1: Create Logging Utility

- [x] **Create inngest-logger.ts utility**
  - Create new file `src/lib/inngest/utils/inngest-logger.ts`
  - Define Logger class with methods: info, error, warning, debug
  - Include function name in all log messages automatically
  - Format logs as `[FunctionName] message` with structured data
  - Support optional context objects
  - Remove need for manual `[functionName]` prefixes throughout code

- [x] **Update all files to use the logger**
  - Replace all `console.log` with `logger.info()` in process-video.ts
  - Replace all `console.log` with `logger.info()` in delete-video-documents.ts
  - Replace all `console.log` with `logger.info()` in delete-user-collection.ts
  - Replace all `console.error` with `logger.error()`
  - Verify logging is now consistent and structured

### Phase 2: Extract Helper Functions from process-video.ts

- [x] **Create video-status.ts utility**
  - Create new file `src/lib/inngest/utils/video-status.ts`
  - Extract `updateVideoStatus` function (lines 26-55 from process-video.ts)
  - Keep existing Supabase logic
  - Add proper error handling
  - Export for use in process-video.ts

- [x] **Create transcript-extractor.ts utility**
  - Create new file `src/lib/inngest/utils/transcript-extractor.ts`
  - Extract `extractTranscriptWithRetry` function (lines 60-90)
  - Extract `extractTranscript` function (lines 95-201)
  - Include all error handling logic
  - Keep retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Use new logger for all logging

- [x] **Create zeroentropy-processor.ts utility**
  - Create new file `src/lib/inngest/utils/zeroentropy-processor.ts`
  - Extract `processTranscriptSegmentsForZeroEntropy` (lines 206-229)
  - Extract `indexTranscriptPagesInZeroEntropy` (lines 234-242)
  - Extract `handleZeroEntropyIndexingFailure` (lines 247-263)
  - Remove type assertions (lines 213, 240, 313, 321, 326)
  - Use new logger instead of console.log

- [x] **Update process-video.ts to use extracted functions**
  - Import all extracted utilities
  - Simplify main function to orchestration only
  - Remove embedded helper functions
  - Reduce file size from 360 to ~111 lines (better than target!)
  - Verify function still works correctly

### Phase 3: Clean Up delete-user-collection.ts

- [x] **Remove redundant logging**
  - Remove duplicate logs on lines 109 and 111-113
  - Keep only essential step logs (start, completion, errors)
  - Remove "log-completion" step (lines 104-109) - it only logs
  - Consolidate final summary logs
  - Verify deletion still works correctly

- [x] **Simplify logic where possible**
  - Review step 2 "get-collection-ids" (lines 53-64)
  - Kept for metrics reporting - functionality unchanged
  - All operations are essential
  - Verified functionality unchanged

### Phase 4: Optimize delete-video-documents.ts

- [x] **Clean up excessive logging**
  - Review all console.log statements
  - Keep logs for: start, key steps, completion, errors
  - Remove redundant intermediate logs
  - Use new logger utility (completed in Phase 1)
  - Logging is already optimized and lean
  - Verify deletion still works correctly

### Phase 5: Remove Type Assertions

- [x] **Clean up type assertions in process-video.ts**
  - Removed type assertion on line 213: `typedTranscriptData as TranscriptData` (done in Phase 2)
  - Removed type assertion on line 240: `typedSegments as ProcessedTranscriptSegment[]` (done in Phase 2)
  - Cleaned up unnecessary assertions in extracted helper functions
  - Remaining assertions (lines 64, 72, 77) are necessary for Inngest step.run compatibility
  - Verified TypeScript compiles without errors

### Phase 6: Create Utils Index File

- [x] **Create utils/index.ts**
  - Create new file `src/lib/inngest/utils/index.ts`
  - Export all utility functions
  - Export logger
  - Create barrel exports for clean imports

### Phase 7: Update Main Function Exports

- [x] **Verify and update exports**
  - Check that `src/lib/inngest/functions/index.ts` exports all functions correctly
  - Ensure imports in API route still work
  - Verify no circular dependencies
  - Test that Inngest functions are still registered
