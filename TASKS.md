# Add Video Transcript Extraction to Inngest - Implementation Plan

## üß† Context about Project

YouTube-GPT is an AI-powered YouTube knowledge base that transforms hours of video content into an instantly searchable, intelligent assistant. The platform serves content creators, researchers, students, and professionals who need to efficiently extract, search, and repurpose information from their personal video libraries. The system uses a three-column ChatGPT-style interface with conversation history, AI chat, and knowledge base management. Built on Next.js 14 with Supabase for authentication and database, the platform currently supports YouTube video ingestion with metadata fetching through Supabase Edge Functions. The system is in active development with core authentication, UI components, and video ingestion working (PENDING ‚Üí QUEUED status flow), but lacks the automated processing pipeline that would transform raw video metadata into searchable, AI-ready content through transcript extraction and vector embeddings.

## üèóÔ∏è Context about Feature

The video transcript extraction feature sits at the critical junction between video ingestion and AI processing in the YouTube-GPT pipeline. Currently, when users add YouTube videos or channels, the system successfully fetches metadata (title, thumbnail, duration, channel info) and stores it in the `videos` table with status tracking (PENDING ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí PROCESSING ‚Üí READY/FAILED). The PENDING ‚Üí QUEUED transition is fully implemented and working correctly. However, there's a gap between the QUEUED status and the next processing step - transcript extraction and vector embedding generation. The feature must integrate with the existing Inngest background job system in `src/lib/inngest/functions/process-video.ts`, leverage the current video status pipeline, and work alongside the real-time status updates already implemented in the frontend. The system needs to detect when a video transitions to 'QUEUED' status and automatically queue it for transcript processing without manual intervention, creating a seamless event-driven pipeline that scales with user activity. We'll use the `youtube-transcript-plus` package which provides advanced features like built-in TypeScript support, comprehensive error handling, caching capabilities, and better reliability compared to the basic youtube-transcript package.

## üéØ Feature Vision & Flow

The desired end-to-end behavior creates a fully automated video processing pipeline where users simply paste YouTube URLs and the system handles everything else. When a video's metadata is successfully fetched and stored, the system automatically detects this status change and triggers an Inngest job for transcript extraction. The job processes the video's transcript using the youtube-transcript-plus library, generates vector embeddings for semantic search, and updates the video status to 'READY' for AI queries. Users see real-time status updates in the Knowledge Base panel, from "Processing metadata..." to "Extracting transcript..." to "Ready for AI queries." The system handles both single videos and batch channel processing, with proper error handling and retry mechanisms for failed jobs. The entire flow is invisible to users - they add videos and can immediately start asking AI questions about their content once processing completes.
