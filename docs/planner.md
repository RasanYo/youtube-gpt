You are a senior product engineer working on a complex AI-powered SaaS platform. I need you to create a comprehensive feature implementation plan for a new feature.

DO NOT write the entire document at once. Work section by section.

The output should follow this format:

🧠 Context about Project
Brief Summary (10–15 lines):
Give context about the project, what it does, and the clients it serves. Write it so someone who has never worked on the project can understand what the system is, why it matters, and what stage the system is at.

🏗️ Context about Feature (10–15 lines)
Describe the relevant platform context and how this feature fits into the system architecture (data models, workflows, user flows, etc.). Mention any technical constraints, important assumptions, or surrounding systems.

🎯 Feature Vision & Flow (10–15 lines)
Describe the desired end-to-end behavior of the feature. Include any notable UX expectations, data flow between systems, and LLM involvement (if any). Keep it product-oriented and high-level here.

📋 Implementation Plan: Tasks & Subtasks

Note: Please mark each task and subtask as complete by changing ⁠[ ]⁠ to ⁠[x]⁠ as you finish them.
Instruction: After completing each top-level task, I will pause to confirm with you that the implementation is correct before moving to the next task.

Break the implementation into well-structured phases. Use checklist syntax ([ ] for tasks, [x] for completed ones if needed). Use indentation and code blocks where necessary for clarity. Explain as if you were explaining to a junior developer, with maximum context and details (files/folders/function names etc). Each subtask should be 2–3 lines.
